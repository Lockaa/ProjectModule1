# ProjectModule1

# Task 1:
Complete basic exercises in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple interactive webpage.

# Assignment:
1. Create a webpage with the following elements:
    A navigation bar (with at least 3 links).
    A section displaying an image and a brief description.
    A form with input fields for name, email, and a submit button.
2. Add JavaScript to:
    Display an alert when the submit button is clicked.
    Validate the form (ensure all fields are filled).

# Deliverables:
    HTML file that includes the webpage structure.
    CSS file for styling the webpage.
    JavaScript code to handle form validation and display an alert.

# Record Log:
    2/5/2025: 
    started planning for projects overall, 16:30 - 18:30 

    2/6/2025: 
    made repository and filled out README with basic information, 13:45 - 14:15
    made index.html and css folder                                14:15
    have basic screen template / layout                           14:15 - 15:15
    filled in data and did extra formatting                       15:15 - 17:45
    Challenges (would like help with this one later):
    getting the formatting to be in the right spot with CSS work (flex box is very sensitive) [boxes were getting 'squished' and the page wouldn't scroll]
